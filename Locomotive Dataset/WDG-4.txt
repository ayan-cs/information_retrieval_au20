The EMD GT46MAC is a freight-hauling diesel-electric locomotive with AC electric transmission built by General Motors Electro-Motive Diesel in 1997–1998 for Indian Railways, where they are classed as WDG4. Thirteen were built by EMD as order #958647, and a further eight were exported in kit form and were assembled in India. The class entered service in 1999. Further construction has been under license in India by the Diesel Locomotive Works (DLW); more than 60 additional locomotives have been built as of 2006. They are numbered from #12001 upward. A similar type, the EMD GT46PAC, has also been produced for passenger service in India. As of 2007, EMD and DLW have begun building GT46Ace's using IGBT technology to replace the older gate turn-off thyristor technology. Newer editions with 4500 hp (3400 kW) have been produced. Over 1000 WDG4 locomotives are currently in operation. Also WDG 4's newer version and dual cab locomotive WDG 4D are better to drive and it has more power.
WDG4: first started operations in 1999 with the numbering starting from 12001 (this loco can still be seen in a splendid condition and is homed at the parent shed of Hubli) Hubli Diesel Locomotive Shed has been operational since 1999, and it houses the maximum number of WDG-4s from 12001-12064, 12067-12153, 12156, 12169, 12189, 12227, 12276, 12311–12313, 12325, 12326. The original WDG4s from 12001–12021 were imported and later on DLW started manufacturing it indigenously. With six traction motors, this locomotive has the capability of touching 105 km/h (65 mph) with a fully loaded freight train of 58 wagons. The locomotive has been praised for its ability to work smoothly in regions with massive gradients, especially in the (Braganza Ghats) and the Subrahmanya ghats having a gradient of 1:37 and 1:50 respectively.
WDG5: With the help of 'RDSO' DLW Varanasi has made the successor of WDG4. In the year 2012 first locomotive was rolled out from DLW Varanasi and for next five years until the production was stopped in 2017 only 6 more units are rolled out. A total of 7 WDG5 class locomotives are made and all of them are destined for Sabarmati loco shed in Gujrat.It is a 5500 hp engine.
