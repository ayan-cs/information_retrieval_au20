WAP5 is the name of a class of "High Speed" electric locomotives produced and used by Indian Railways. The first 10 locomotives were imported from ABB in Switzerland in 1995. They are supposed to be a variant of the Swiss Lok 2000 (Design concept) and German DB Class 120 (mechanical chassis). One of the notable features of WAP-5 is regenerative braking. Other notable features of this loco are the provision of taps from the main loco transformer for hotel load, pantry loads, flexible gear coupling, wheel-mounted disc brakes, and a potential for speed enhancement to 200 km/h (120 mph). Braking systems include 160 kN (36,000 lbf) regenerative brakes, loco disc brakes, automatic train air brakes, and a charged spring parking brake.On 3 July 2014, a WAP-5 set an Indian speed record by hauling a train from Delhi to Agra within 90 minutes at a speed of 160 km/h (99 mph).The Gatimaan Express and Bhopal Shatabdi trains hauled by WAP-5 locomotives travel at 160 km/h (99 mph) and 150 km/h (93 mph) respectively in the New Delhi - Agra Cantt section.
